            <span class="rono"><p>We all hear about cancer and how 
                dangerous is it, in this topic we will going to 
                know what is the biology of cancer, why we 
                didn't find a Solution of it and what is 
                cancer risk factors?</p></span>
            <br>
            <p>Cancer is an abnormality in a cell's internal regulatory mechanisms that 
                results in uncontrolled growth and reproduction of the cell. This sounds 
                simple, but there are probably more regulatory interactions occurring within a 
                cell than there are interactions among people in New York City in any given 
                day.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Normal cells make up tissues, and when these cells lose their ability to 
                behave as a specified, controlled and coordinated unit (dedifferentiation) the 
                defect leads to disarray amongst the cell population. When this occurs, a 
                tumor is formed. (More about this later.) Cancer is a term describing a large 
                variety of disorders of proliferation. The specific disorder may vary from tissue 
                type to tissue type. A single tumor may even have different populations of 
                cells within it with differing processes that have gone awry</p>

            <span class="rono"><p>How Does Cancer Develop?</p></span>
            <br>
            <p>Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control 
                the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Genetic changes that cause cancer can happen because:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>of errors that occur as cells divide.</li>
                <li>of damage to DNA caused by harmful substances in the environment, such as 
                    the chemicals in tobacco smoke and ultraviolet from the sun.</li>
                <li>they were inherited from our parents.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The body normally eliminates cells with damaged DNA before they turn cancerous. 
                But the body’s ability to do so goes down as we age. This is part of the reason why 
                there is a higher risk of cancer later in life.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Each person’s cancer has a unique combination of genetic changes. As the cancer 
                continues to grow, additional changes will occur. Even within the same tumor, 
                different cells may have different genetic changes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Cancer is not just one disease to understand why we haven’t cured cancer yet, the most 
                important thing to know is that cancer is not one disease. Instead, it’s an umbrella term for more than 
                200 distinct diseases – that’s why we fund research into any type of cancer.</p>

                how do you feel these feelings?</p></span>
            <br>
            <p>Good, let me tell you there where a chemical which controlling your mood in our brain.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While there are many external factors that can influence your mood like the 
                weather and your relationships, there are also four main chemicals that play a 
                big role, including serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline and oxytocin. But to 
                understand this, you need to first know a little bit about how our brain works. 
                So, what’s the relationship between brain and mood? The brain controls the 
                release of certain chemicals – called neurotransmitters – which communicate 
                with other areas of the brain to stimulate or calm us. This then has influence 
                on our mood, emotions and behaviour.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It’s also important to know that a chemical imbalance in your brain, is when 
                you’re making either too much or too little of certain neurotransmitters. This 
                may contribute to a mood disorder or mental health condition if left 
                uncorrected. However, the reasons why mental health issues develop in some 
                people and not others are much more complex than their levels of brain 
                chemicals alone.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Let’s dive into four different types of neurotransmitters, to find out more about 
                the amazing chemical reactions going on in the brain. Plus, learn a few tips on 
                how to get more feel-good chemicals in your life, naturally.</p>
            <br>
            <span class="rono"><p>Serotonin - the mood regulator</p></span>
            <br>
            <p>Serotonin plays an important role in regulating your mood.
            </p>
            <br>
            <span class="rono"><p>How does serotonin affect your mood?
            </p></span>
            <br>
            <p>Serotonin is responsible for your feelings of happiness, wellbeing and the 
                stability of your mood. It also helps regulate your sleep cycle and other 
                processes in your body including your appetite. While dopamine is probably 
                more famously known as the ‘happy hormone’, serotonin is also one of the 
                ‘feel good’ chemicals you need!</p>
            <br>
            <p>when you have an enough levels of serotonin, you feel emotionally stable and calm and 
                you’ll also have noticeably higher levels of energy and focus.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Low levels of serotonin are also thought to contribute to feelings of depression. Boosting serotonin 
                levels can also help with anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder 
                and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>

            <br>
            <span class="rono"><p>Dopamine - the feel-good hormone</p></span>
            <br>
            <p>Dopamine is known as the feel-good neurotransmitter and it plays a role in controlling your mood. It’s 
                also important for memory and motor skills. It acts like a reward and the brain releases it when we do 
                things we love like eating our favorite foods.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dopamine allows you to feel:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>pleasure</li>
                <li>satisfaction</li>

            <br>
            <span class="rono"><p>How to boost your feel-good chemicals?</p></span>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Eating foods reach in fish, Poultry, Dairy products, Strawberries, Green leafy vegetables, Green tea, 
                    Eggs, Nuts, Coffee</li>
                <li>avoiding processed foods</li>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Adrenaline – helping us stay safe</p>
            <br>
            <p>Adrenaline, or epinephrine, is responsible for your body’s ‘fight or flight’ response. It helps you react 
                quickly in a dangerous or stressful situation. Adrenaline is the hormone released when your brain 
                perceives excitement, danger, fear, or a potential threat. You might feel a mix of all of those emotions 
                when doing something like skydiving for example, which is a time when your body is likely to be ‘full of 
                adrenaline’.<br>Adrenaline rush.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When adrenaline gets released quickly, it’s known as an ‘adrenaline rush’. When this happens, you 
                might notice the following symptoms:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>sweating</li>
                <li>feeling jittery or nervous</li>
                <li>rapid heartbeat</li>
                <li>increase in strength and performance</li>
                <li>decrease in ability to feel pain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Some people enjoy the feeling of an ‘adrenaline rush’ and deliberately do 
                activities that trigger it. These can include skydiving, bungee jumping, and 
                cage diving with sharks.</p>
            <br>
            <span class="rono"><p>Oxytocin – the ‘warm and fuzzy’ one</p></span>
            <br>
            <p>Oxytocin is known as the “love hormone” and it can promote trust, empathy, 
                and bonding in relationships. Along with serotonin and dopamine, oxytocin 
                completes the trio of feel-good chemicals. Oxytocin is used by the body in 
                childbirth, breastfeeding and sex. Low levels of oxytocin have been linked with 
                depression but we don’t completely understand the role of oxytocin in building 
                relationships and more research is needed. How oxytocin regulates mood is 
                also not straightforward. Boosting oxytocin levels may help to treat social 
                phobia, depression, and anger problems.

            <br>
            <p>A sarcoma is a rare type of malignant (cancerous) tumor that develops in 
                bone and connective tissue, such as fat, muscle, blood vessels, nerves and
                the tissue that surrounds bones and joints. Symptoms depend on the tumor’s 
                size and location. Treatments include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, 
                targeted therapy and immunotherapy.</p>
            <br>
            <span class="rono"><p>What is sarcoma?</p></span>
            <br>
            <p>A sarcoma is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that develops in bone and/or soft 
                tissue. Soft tissues support other body structures and include Muscle, Fat, 
                Tendons, Cartilage, Ligaments, Blood vessels, Nerves.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Sarcomas are rare, making up only 1% of all adult cancer diagnoses and 
                about 15% of childhood cancer diagnoses. Approximately 16,000 sarcomas 
                are diagnosed in the United States each year (around 4,000 bone sarcomas 
                and approximately 13,000 soft tissue sarcomas).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Along time ago Fred Stein, a German immigrant who worked as a 
                housepainter, had a rapidly growing sarcoma in his neck. After four operations 
                and four recurrences of the cancer, a senior surgeon declared Stein’s case 
                “absolutely hopeless.” Then an infection caused by streptococcal bacteria 
                broke out in red patches across Stein’s neck and face. There were no 
                antibiotics at the time, so his immune system was left to fight off the infection 
                unaided. Remarkably, as his white blood cells combatted the bacteria, the 
                sarcoma shrank into a bland scar. Stein left the hospital with no infection and 
                no discernible cancer. Coley concluded that something in Stein’s own body 
                had shrunk the cancer.

            <p>Immunotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that helps your immune system 
                fight cancer. The immune system helps your body fight infections and other 
                diseases. It is made up of white blood cells and organs and tissues of the

            <br>
            <p>As part of its normal function, the immune system detects and destroys

                For instance, immune cells are sometimes found in and around tumors. These 
                cells, called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TILs, are a sign that the immune 
                system is responding to the tumor. People whose tumors contain TILs often 
                do better than people whose tumors don’t contain them.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Even though the immune system can prevent or slow cancer growth, cancer 
                cells have ways to avoid destruction by the immune system. For example, 
                cancer cells may:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Have genetic changes that make them less visible to the immune 
                    system.</li>
                <li>Have proteins on their surface that turn off immune cells.</li>
                <li>Change the normal cells around the tumor so they interfere with how the 
                    immune system responds to the cancer cells.</li>
                <br>
                </ul>
                <p>Immunotherapy helps the immune system to better act against cancer.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Several types of immunotherapy are used to treat cancer. These include: In 
                    2015, Drs. Aziz Sancar, Paul Modrich, and Tomas Lindahl received the prestigious 
                    Nobel Prize in chemistry for mechanistic studies of DNA repair. Every day, our DNA is 
                    damaged by environmental assaults, as well as copy errors during cell division. Yet, our 
                    genomes remain largely intact. The 2015 Nobel laureates in chemistry were recognized 
                    for detailing at the molecular level how cells repair DNA to preserve the genome. Dr. 
                    Sancar described how cells respond to DNA injuries from ultraviolet radiation or 
                    chemicals like the carcinogens found in cigarette smoke. Dr. Modrich detailed how cells 
                    address the copy errors in the genetic code that accumulate naturally during cell 
                    division. And Dr. Lindahl discovered a molecular machine that constantly counteracts 
                    the decay of our DNA. NIGMS funded Drs. Sancar and Modrich for many years, 
                    including time spent on this research.</p>

                    generation to the next? Thisis what we will 
                    know in genetics.</p>
                <br>
                <span class="rono"><p>Gregor Mendel: the ‘father of genetics’</p></span>
                <br>
                <p>In the 19th century, it was commonly believed that an organism’s traits were passed on to offspring in a 
                    blend of characteristics ‘donated’ by each parent.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Heredity was poorly understood in general, and the concept of a gene did not exist at all. However, 
                    Austrian monk Gregor Mendel was unconvinced with traditional explanations of how traits were passed 
                    from one generation to another.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Between 1856 and 1863, Mendel decided to try and work out the principles of heredity himself, with the 
                    assistance of the humble garden pea (Pisum sativum L.).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Among the many species on which Mendel worked, he selected pea because the plants and seeds have 
                    a wide array of distinct features that occur in two easily identifiable forms (e.g. seed shape – round or 
                    wrinkled; plant height – tall or short).</p>
                <br>
                <p>The pea flower is another useful feature of these plants, as it ensures that the flowers of the hybridized
                    and parent plants are protected from any foreign pollen. The relatively short growth period is another 
                    advantage, meaning there was not a long wait for the results.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Over eight years, Mendel studied pea traits one at a time and crossbred variants to systematically record 
                    how traits were passed on from one generation to the next: a mammoth task that involved 
                    approximately 28,000 pea plants.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Mendel’s study produced astonishing results and found very similar patterns of inheritance for all seven 
                    features he studied. He also identified a consistent mathematical formula that explained the frequency 
                    with which each trait appeared and observed dominant and recessive traits.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Despite the results being published in the ‘Proceedings of the Brunn Society for the Study of Natural 
                    Sciences’ in 1866, Mendel’s work was widely ignored by the scientific community during his lifetime.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Before Mendel’s experiments on the garden peas, Thomas Andrew Knight (in 1799) and John Goss (in 
                    1822), both from England, had carried out breeding experiments in the same plant.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When crossing plants yielding green peas with others yielding yellowish-white peas, Goss noted that, in 
                    the first generation, only yellowish-white peas were produced. Breeding from these hybrids, he was 
                    astonished to get three types of plants: one had only green peas, one only yellowish-white, and the third 
                    kind had both green and yellowish-white in the same pod.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Despite making some interesting observations, neither Knight nor Goss counted the number of peas 
                    with particular traits and consequently failed to discover the hereditary mechanism.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In 1900, three European botanists – Hugo De Vries (Holland), Carl Correns (Germany) and Erich von
                    Tschermak (Austria) were independently carrying out heredity research themselves and uncovered 
                    Mendel’s findings.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The new field of genetics was born and Mendel became regarded as the ‘father of genetics’, although 
                    the terms ‘gene’ and ‘genetics’ would be coined much later.</p>
                <br>
                <span class="rono"><p>Mendel’s legacy at the John Innes Centre</p></span>
                <br>
                <p>William Bateson, the first Director of the John Innes in 1910, was a firm advocate of Mendel’s theory.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bateson initially introduced ‘Mendelism’ to Britain, when he translated his paper into English in the early 
                    20th century. Bateson further championed Mendel’s work when he gave a lecture in 1916 titled ‘15 
                    years of Mendelism’.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bateson would go on to coin the word ‘genetics’ and much of the discipline’s other terminology, then in 
                    1910 the John Innes Institute became the first research institute devoted to Mendelian genetics in 
                    Britain, in which a programme of research was initiated to apply and test Mendel’s theory. This research 
                    became a launch pad for the start of a long history of pea research at the John Innes Institute.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Later research confirmed the gene (Mendel’s ‘factor’) as the unit of heredity and the chromosome as 
                    the physical structure which carried the genes. Additionally, exceptions to Mendel’s principles have 
                    been discovered as our knowledge of genes and inheritance has increased.
                    </p>
                <br>
                <p>Work at the John Innes Institute has characterized Mendel’s genes at the molecular level, drawing on 
                    resources from our Germplasm Resource Unit, which houses over 3,500 variants of pea.

                <span class="rono"><p>What is genetics?</p></span>
                <br>
                <p>Genetics is the scientific study of genes and heredity—of how certain qualities or traits are passed from 
                    parents to offspring as a result of changes in DNA sequence. A gene is a segment of DNA that contains 
                    instructions for building one or more molecules that help the body work. DNA is shaped like a 
                    corkscrew-twisted ladder, called a double helix. The two ladder rails are called backbones, and the rungs 
                    are pairs of four building blocks (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) called bases. The sequences 
                    of these bases provide the instructions for building molecules, most of which are proteins. Researchers 
                    estimate that humans have about 20,000 genes.</p>
                <br>
                <p>All of an organism’s genetic material, including its genes and other elements that control the activity of 
                    those genes, is its genome. An organism’s entire genome is found in nearly all of its cells. In human, 
                    plant, and animal cells, the genome is housed in a structure called the nucleus. The human genome is 
                    mostly the same in all people with just small variations. For more on the human genome, visit the 
                    National Human Genome Research Institute’s About Genomics webpage.</p>
                <br>
                <span class="rono"><p>How are genes inherited?</p></span>
                <br>
                <p>Our DNA, including all of our genes, is stored in chromosomes, structures where proteins wind up DNA 
                    tightly so that it fits in the nucleus. Humans typically have 23 pairs of chromosomes in our cells. The two 
                    chromosomes in each pair contain the same genes, but they may have different versions of those genes 
                    because we inherit one chromosome in each pair from our mother and the other from our father. 
                    Reproductive cells—eggs and sperm—randomly receive one chromosome from each of the 23 sets 
                    instead of both so that a fertilized egg will contain the 23 pairs needed for typical development.</p>
                <br>
                <span class="rono"><p>How do genes affect health and disease?</p></span>
                <br>
                <P>Changes in genes can prevent the gene from doing its job the way it normally would. Some differences 
                    in DNA, for example, can lead to incorrectly formed proteins that can’t perform their functions. Also, 
                    genetic variations can influence how people respond to certain medicines or a person’s likelihood of 
                    developing a disease. Because parents pass their genes on to their children, some diseases tend to 
                    cluster in families, similar to other inherited traits. In most cases, multiple genes are involved. 
                    Researchers can use DNA sequencing to identify variations in a person’s genome.</P>

                <p>Some variations between individuals result from epigenetic differences. These are changes in gene 
                    function, some of which can be inherited but are not the result of changes in DNA sequence.</p>

                <span class="rono"><p>Why do scientists study the genes of other organisms?</p></span>
                <br>
                <p>All living things evolved from a common ancestor. Therefore, humans, animals, and other organisms 
                    share many of the same genes, and the molecules made from them function in similar ways.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Scientists have found many genes that have been preserved through millions of years of evolution and 
                    are present in a range of organisms living today. They can study these preserved genes and compare the 
                    genomes of different species to uncover similarities and differences that improve their understanding of 
                    how human genes function and are controlled. This knowledge helps researchers develop new 
                    strategies to treat and prevent human disease. Scientists also study the genes of bacteria, viruses, and 
                    fungi for solutions to prevent or treat infection. Increasingly, these studies are offering insight into how 
                    microbes on and in the body affect our health, sometimes in beneficial ways.</p>

                <br>
                <p>In 2015, Drs. Aziz Sancar, Paul Modrich, and Tomas Lindahl received the prestigious Nobel Prize in 
                    chemistry for mechanistic studies of DNA repair. Every day, our DNA is damaged by environmental 
                    assaults, as well as copy errors during cell division. Yet, our genomes remain largely intact. The 2015 
                    Nobel laureates in chemistry were recognized for detailing at the molecular level how cells repair DNA 
                    to preserve the genome. Dr. Sancar described how cells respond to DNA injuries from ultraviolet 
                    radiation or chemicals like the carcinogens found in cigarette smoke. Dr. Modrich detailed how cells 
                    address the copy errors in the genetic code that accumulate naturally during cell division. And Dr. 
                    Lindahl discovered a molecular machine that constantly counteracts the decay of our DNA. NIGMS 
                    funded Drs. Sancar and Modrich for many years, including time spent on this research.</p>
